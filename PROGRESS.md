# RhinoSecure — Progress Log

Factual, dated record of what changed and why. Not a design doc — see CLAUDE.md for the
current spec and rationale; this file is the history of how it got there.

**KEV + EPSS wired into the threat term.** KEV and EPSS are treated as different kinds of
claim: EPSS is a model's probability estimate, KEV is CISA's record of confirmed exploitation.
EPSS sets the likelihood multiplier (`0.6 + epss`, range 0.6–1.6); KEV sets a **floor** under
it (`max(epss_multiplier, 1.5)`) instead of multiplying on top of it, so an observation can't
be diluted by — or compounded with — a prediction that disagrees with it. A KEV CVE the model
underrates gets pulled up to the floor; a KEV CVE the model already rates highly is left alone.

**Fixture repair: KEV and EPSS were both non-discriminating.** The original 15-finding fixture
was built from famous anchor CVEs (ProxyLogon, ZeroLogon, PrintNightmare, etc.). Checked
against the live feeds: 13/15 (87%) were KEV-listed and 14/15 (93%) had EPSS above 0.92 — both
signals near-saturated, so wiring them in would have added almost no spread. Added 9 real,
verified mundane Windows CVEs (outdated/superseded components, info disclosure, local privesc
requiring prior access), each checked live and kept only if EPSS < 0.05 and not KEV-listed.
Fixture is now 24 findings across 12 assets.

**Bucket rule: KEV disqualifies `accept`.** A KEV-listed finding can no longer land in
`accept` — confirmed exploitation and "we are fine with this" are incompatible. `is_kev` forces
at least the actionable tier; the existing compensating-control/patch-window logic still picks
`mitigate_monitor` vs `next_window` within it, unchanged. The one combination that logic can't
resolve honestly — KEV-listed, no compensating control, no patch window — has no truthful
bucket among the four remediation categories, so it's marked `contested` instead of forced into
one. Added as `Bucket.CONTESTED`, documented as the first concrete trigger for Slice 4's
Tree-of-Thought gate (not yet built).

**The contested rule found more than it was built for.** It was scoped against 4 findings that
were sitting in `accept`. Applied, it also caught `F11` (WKS-IT05, SMBGhost) and `F07`
(WKS-FIN12, Follina) — both already in `next_window`, both KEV-listed, both with no
compensating control and no patch window. `next_window` was silently implying they were
scheduled when nothing was. Neither finding was in the discussion that produced the rule; the
rule caught them anyway because the condition it checks (`is_kev` + no control + no window) is
what mattered, not the bucket a finding happened to start in.

**Live instance of why snapshotting matters.** `CVE-2019-1068` (on the fixture's `F15`, added
last session specifically to exercise `mitigate_monitor`) entered the CISA KEV catalog on
2026-08-26 — one day before this session — with a due date of 2026-08-29, a three-day window.
Mid-project, a fixture CVE picked for an unrelated reason became actively exploited with an
active remediation deadline. `data/snapshots/kev.json` is pinned to the version fetched this
session; without that, a rerun next week would silently produce different KEV/EPSS numbers for
the same fixture, breaking the reproducibility CLAUDE.md Section 4 requires.
